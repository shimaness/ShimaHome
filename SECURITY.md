## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Email verification required
   - Strong password policy
   - Optional MFA

2. **Authorization Layer**
   - Role-based access control
   - Session validation
   - Token rotation

3. **Monitoring Layer**
   - Failed login tracking
   - Security event logging
   - Anomaly detection ready

4. **Response Layer**
   - Account lockout
   - Session revocation
   - Email notifications

### Data Protection
- **Password Storage**
  - bcrypt hashing (cost factor 10)

  - Never logged or exposed

- **Token Security**
  - JWT for access tokens (15-min expiry)
  - Hashed refresh tokens (30-day expiry)
  - Rotation on use
  - Revocation support

- **MFA Secrets**
  - Base32 encoded TOTP secrets
  - Stored encrypted at rest
  - Backup codes hashed (SHA-256)

- **Session Data**
  - Device fingerprints hashed
  - IP addresses for audit only
  - No PII in logs

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Settings
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5          # Failed attempts before lockout
LOCK_DURATION_MINUTES=15      # Lockout duration
ACCESS_TTL=15m                # JWT access token lifetime
REFRESH_TTL_DAYS=30           # Refresh token lifetime

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_DEV_MODE=true           # Dev mode: log instead of send
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@shimahome.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Web Origin (for links in emails)
WEB_ORIGIN=https://your-site.vercel.app
```

### SMTP Setup (Production)

#### Gmail
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use App Password as `SMTP_PASS`

#### SendGrid
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

#### AWS SES
```bash
SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-ses-smtp-username
SMTP_PASS=your-ses-smtp-password
```

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Failed login rate
- Account lockout frequency
- MFA adoption rate
- New device detection rate
- Session duration averages
- Password reset frequency

### Alerts to Configure
- Spike in failed logins
- Mass account lockouts
- High MFA disable rate
- Unusual geographic access patterns

## üö® Incident Response

### Account Compromise
1. User reports suspicious activity
2. Admin reviews security events
3. Force password reset
4. Revoke all sessions
5. Enable mandatory MFA
6. Review access logs

### Brute Force Attack
1. Automatic account lockout triggers
2. Email sent to account owner
3. Review login attempt patterns
4. Block IP ranges if needed
5. Increase lockout duration temporarily
