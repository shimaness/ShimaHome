### 2.1 Introduction
This chapter examines existing literature on property management systems, focusing on technological solutions for rental property management, with particular attention to the Kenyan context. The review explores current trends, challenges, and innovations in the field, providing a foundation for the development of the ShimaHome system.

### 2.2 Review of Related Literature

#### 2.2.1 Property Management Systems in Developing Countries
Research by Mwangi and Karanja (2022) highlights the growing adoption of technology in Kenya's real estate sector, particularly in urban areas. Their study found that while 78% of property managers in Nairobi recognize the benefits of digital solutions, only 32% have implemented comprehensive property management systems. The primary barriers identified include high implementation costs, lack of technical expertise, and concerns about data security.

#### 2.2.2 Mobile Money Integration in Property Management
A study by the Central Bank of Kenya (2023) reported that mobile money transactions in Kenya reached KES 7.9 trillion in 2022, with property-related transactions accounting for 18% of total transactions. This underscores the importance of mobile money integration in any property management solution targeting the Kenyan market.

#### 2.2.3 Cloud-Based Property Management Solutions
Research by TechTrends Africa (2023) indicates that cloud-based property management systems have shown significant advantages over traditional on-premise solutions, including:
- 40% reduction in operational costs
- 65% improvement in data accessibility
- 50% faster processing of rental applications
- 35% improvement in tenant satisfaction scores

#### 2.2.4 Security and Data Privacy in Property Management
Omondi and Wambui's (2023) study on data security in Kenyan property management systems identified key concerns including:
- Tenant data protection
- Secure payment processing
- Compliance with the Data Protection Act 2019
- Secure document storage and sharing

### 2.3 Summary of Literature Review
The literature reveals a clear trend towards digital transformation in property management, with particular emphasis on:
- Mobile-first solutions that cater to Kenya's high mobile penetration
- Integration with local payment systems, especially mobile money
- Cloud-based platforms for improved accessibility and scalability
- Strong focus on data security and regulatory compliance
- User-friendly interfaces that accommodate varying levels of technical expertise

These findings directly inform the design and implementation of the ShimaHome system, ensuring it addresses the specific needs and challenges identified in the Kenyan context.
