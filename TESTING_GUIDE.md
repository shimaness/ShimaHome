## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Welcome Screen Doesn't Appear
**Symptom**: Login redirects directly without splash

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check if userRole cookie is set

# Should see: userRole=LANDLORD or userRole=TENANT
```

**Solution**: Check `/api/auth/login/route.ts` - line 44-46

### Issue 2: No Properties in Discovery Feed
**Symptom**: "No homes found" message

**Check**:
1. Property status is ACTIVE (not UNDER_REVIEW)
2. Unit occupancyStatus is VACANT

```sql
-- Update property to ACTIVE
UPDATE "PropertyListing" SET status = 'ACTIVE' WHERE id = 'your-property-id';
```

**Check**:
1. File size < 10MB

```

### Issue 4: Tagged Photos Not Showing

**Check**:
- Database has `photoTag` field populated
- Tags are valid enum values

**Fix in Prisma Studio**:
- Check `UnitPhoto` table
